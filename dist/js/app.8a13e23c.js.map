   * Supports both binary and ASCII encoded files, with automatic detection of type.\n         *\n         * The loader returns a non-indexed buffer geometry.\n         *\n         * Limitations:\n         *  Binary decoding supports \"Magics\" color format (http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/STL_(file_format)#Color_in_binary_STL).\n         *  There is perhaps some question as to how valid it is to always assume little-endian-ness.\n         *  ASCII decoding assumes file is UTF-8.\n         *\n         * Usage:\n         *  const loader = new STLLoader();\n         *  loader.load( './models/stl/slotted_disk.stl', function ( geometry ) {\n         *    scene.add( new THREE.Mesh( geometry ) );\n         *  });\n         *\n         * For binary STLs geometry might contain colors for vertices. To use it:\n         *  // use the same code to load STL as above\n         *  if (geometry.hasColors) {\n         *    material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({ opacity: geometry.alpha, vertexColors: true });\n         *  } else { .... }\n         *  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );\n         *\n         * For ASCII STLs containing multiple solids, each solid is assigned to a different group.\n         * Groups can be used to assign a different color by defining an array of materials with the same length of\n         * geometry.groups and passing it to the Mesh constructor:\n         *\n         * const mesh = new THREE.Mesh( geometry, material );\n         *\n         * For example:\n         *\n         *  const materials = [];\n         *  const nGeometryGroups = geometry.groups.length;\n         *\n         *  const colorMap = ...; // Some logic to index colors.\n         *\n         *  for (let i = 0; i < nGeometryGroups; i++) {\n         *\n         *\t\tconst material = new THREE.MeshPhongMaterial({\n         *\t\t\tcolor: colorMap[i],\n         *\t\t\twireframe: false\n         *\t\t});\n         *\n         *  }\n         *\n         *  materials.push(material);\n         *  const mesh = new THREE.Mesh(geometry, materials);\n         */\n\n\n        class STLLoader_STLLoader extends Loader {\n\n          constructor( manager ) {\n\n            super( manager );\n\n          }\n\n          load( url, onLoad, onProgress, onError ) {\n\n            const scope = this;\n\n            const loader = new FileLoader( this.manager );\n            loader.setPath( this.path );\n            loader.setResponseType( 'arraybuffer' );\n            loader.setRequestHeader( this.requestHeader );\n            loader.setWithCredentials( this.withCredentials );\n\n            loader.load( url, function ( text ) {\n\n              try {\n\n                onLoad( scope.parse( text ) );\n\n              } catch ( e ) {\n\n                if ( onError ) {\n\n                  onError( e );\n\n                } else {\n\n                  console.error( e );\n\n                }\n\n                scope.manager.itemError( url );\n\n              }\n\n            }, onProgress, onError );\n\n          }\n\n          parse( data ) {\n\n            function isBinary( data ) {\n\n              const reader = new DataView( data );\n              const face_size = ( 32 / 8 * 3 ) + ( ( 32 / 8 * 3 ) * 3 ) + ( 16 / 8 );\n              const n_faces = reader.getUint32( 80, true );\n              const expect = 80 + ( 32 / 8 ) + ( n_faces * face_size );\n\n              if ( expect === reader.byteLength ) {\n\n                return true;\n\n              }\n\n              // An ASCII STL data must begin with 'solid ' as the first six bytes.\n              // However, ASCII STLs lacking the SPACE after the 'd' are known to be\n              // plentiful.
